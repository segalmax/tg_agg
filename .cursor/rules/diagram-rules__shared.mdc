- use the maximum features of mermaid diagrams
- Use components inside components for different systems/ VMs/ dbs / UIs / configs for clarity 
- Add sequential numbers showing the order of operations (in forked executions do 6a, 6b, etc)
- Use best conventions for readable diagrams (colors, shapes, etc.)
- Make diagrams beautiful and professional
