Create or update a relevant doc (grep *.md files in codebase if needed) with the most important general "tribal knowledge" learned during this chat.

Important:
 - Reread the **whole** doc to know what info needs to be added and updated.
 - This doc should be general, not tailored to the specific task performed
 - Act as a senior developer who knows what to prioritize: env insights, db schema, general stats, and codebase patterns
 - Focus on **REUSABLE** knowledge, not specific cases
