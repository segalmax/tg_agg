# Mobile-Responsive Bootstrap 5 Implementation

## Summary
Successfully converted the Telegram aggregator from desktop-only custom CSS to a mobile-friendly Bootstrap 5 interface with YouTube-like grid layout.

## What Changed

### 1. Base Template (`videos/templates/videos/base.html`)
- Added Bootstrap 5.3.2 CDN (CSS + JS)
- Added responsive navbar with sticky top positioning
- Minimal custom CSS for video cards and hover effects
- Mobile viewport meta tag included

### 2. Video Grid (`videos/templates/videos/post_list.html`)
- Responsive grid: 2 columns (mobile), 3 (tablet), 4-5 (desktop)
- Bootstrap cards with video thumbnails
- Click cards to open detail view
- Desktop sidebar filters (visible on md+ screens)
- Mobile offcanvas filter panel (slides from right)
- Floating filter button on mobile (bottom-right)
- Bootstrap pagination component

### 3. Filter Form (`videos/templates/videos/filter_form.html`)
- Reusable component for both desktop sidebar and mobile offcanvas
- All original filters maintained:
  - Search
  - Channel selector
  - Media type (video/photo/all)
  - Date range (from/to)
  - Sort options (date, views, forwards, replies)
- Auto-submit on filter change

### 4. Video Detail Page (`videos/templates/videos/post_detail.html`)
- Full-screen video player
- Complete post information (text, stats, date)
- Prev/Next navigation:
  - Desktop: Button below video
  - Mobile: Floating buttons on left/right edges
  - Keyboard: Arrow keys
- Preserves filter context when navigating back to grid
- Telegram markdown parsing (bold, italic, code)

### 5. Backend (`videos/views.py`)
- Added `post_detail()` view
- Maintains filter context for prev/next navigation
- Respects all existing filters when finding adjacent posts

### 6. Routes (`videos/urls.py`)
- Added `/post/<username>/<post_id>/` route

## What Stayed the Same
- All Django models (Channel, Post)
- Video fetching API (`/api/video/...`)
- All filtering and sorting logic
- Data import scripts
- Database structure
